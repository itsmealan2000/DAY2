            Ernakulam district is an amalgam of a hoary heritage and global
            growth of industry and commerce. For the outside world, Ernakulam is
            part of Kochi referred to in the history of Kerala as the Queen of
            Arabian Sea. The densely populated Ernakulam district embodies the
            achievements of the Kerala State in literacy, industry, trade and
            commerce. With an inclusive culture, relatively high per capita
            income and an unstoppable interest of the people in updating
            themselves of the political, economic, social and cultural
            happenings in the national and international spheres, Ernakulam
            represents the high modern phase of the Kerala society. The Kerala
            High Court, the office of the Kochi Municipal Corporation and the
            Cochin Stock Exchange are situated here. The Ernakulam Junction is a
            major railway station of the Indian Railways. Ernakulam was once the
