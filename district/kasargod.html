            Kasaragod district is one of the 14 districts in the southern Indian
            state of Kerala. The district is bordered to the south by Kerala's
            Kannur district, and to the southeast and north by Karnataka's
            districts of Kodagu and Dakshina Kannada respectively. To the east,
            the district is bordered by the Western Ghats, while along the west,
            it is bordered by the Laccadive Sea. Kasaragod was known to the
            Arabs by the name Harkwillia. Many Arab travelers who visited Kerala
            between the 9th and the 14th centuries visited Kasaragod, which was
            an important trade centre then.

            Bekal Fort is the largest fort in Kerala, spreading over 40 acres
            (160,000 m2).The fort appears to emerge from the sea. Almost three
            quarters of its exterior is in contact with water. Bekal fort was
            not an administrative centre and does not include any palaces or
            mansions. An important feature is the water-tank, magazine and the
            flight of steps leading to an observation tower built by Tipu
            Sultan. Standing at the centre of the fort, this offers views of the
            coastline and the towns of Kanhangad, Pallikkara, Bekal,
            Kottikkulam, and Uduma. The fort's zigzag entrance and surrounding
            trenches reveal its defensive strategy. Holes on the outer walls are
            designed to defend the fort effectively from naval attacks. The
            upper holes meant for aiming at the farthest targets; lower holes
            below for striking as enemy nearer and the lowest holes to attacking
            enemy closest to the fort.
