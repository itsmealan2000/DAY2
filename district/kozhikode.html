            Kozhikode, also known as Calicut is the second-largest urban
            agglomeration in the State of Kerala and 20th largest in the country
            with a population of 2 million according to 2011 census. During
            classical antiquity and the Middle Ages, Kozhikode was dubbed the
            City of Spices for its role as the major trading point of Indian
            spices.

            a strong mercantile aspect. The main area of business was once

            cultural fest of Kozhikode, every year has been conducting a
            five-day music festival. Kozhikode has a tradition of Ghazal and
            Hindustani music appreciation. Kozhikode is home to two premier
            educational institutions of national importance: the Indian
            Institute of Management Kozhikode (IIMK), and the National Institute
            of Technology, Calicut (NITC). Other institutions include National
