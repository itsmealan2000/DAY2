            is built on an elevated ground, at the apex of which is the famous
            “Vadakkumnathan” Temple. It is also known as gods own town , it is
            famous for pooram festival, one of the most celebrated festival in

            after Kochi and Calicut urban areas and the 20th largest in India.

            of its cultural, spiritual and religious leanings throughout

            the Thekkinkadu Maidan which seats the Vadakkumnathan temple. One of

            Athirappilly Falls is situated in Thrissur District, which
            originates from the upper reaches of the Western Ghats at the
            entrance to the Sholayar ranges. It is the largest waterfall in
            Kerala, which stands tall at 80 feet. Just a short drive from
            Athirappilly to the Vazhachal falls, which is close to dense green
            forests that are home to many endangered and endemic species of
            flora and fauna. The 145 kilometres long Chalakudy River, originates
            in the Anamudi mountains of the Western Ghats and flows through the
            Vazhachal Forest toward the Arabian Sea. Forest wildlife in the area
            includes the Asiatic elephant, tiger, leopard, bison, sambar, and
            lion-tailed macaque. The unique 180 metres elevation riparian forest
            in the Athirappilly-Vazhachal area is the only location where all
            four South Indian species of hornbills — the great hornbill (the
            state bird of Kerala), Malabar pied hornbill, Malabar grey hornbill,
            and the Indian grey hornbill are found living together.
