            Malappuram is situated in the mid land area of the state. As the
            name suggests, it is covered with small mountains of lush greenery,
            bonded with several freshwater streams flowing through the city.
            Bounded by the Nilgiris hills on the East and the Arabian Sea on the
            west, the district of Malappuram literally the land atop the hills,
            is remarkable for its unique natural beauty. Perched among the
            undulating hills and the meandering rivers that flow to reach the
            coconut-fringed seacoast, the land conceals a unique and eventful
            history.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text paragraph">
            Malappuram also contributed much to the cultural artistic traditions
            of the state. The mosques and temples of the land are known for
            their spectacular festivals. The land of great poets and writers,
            political and religious leaders, the district has carved a unique
            place of its own in the history of Kerala.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text paragraph">
            Kadalundi Puzha, a major river in Kerala is flowing around the city.
            However, there are some pre-historic relics, particularly Rock-cut
            caves found in some parts of the city like Oorakam, Melmuri,
            Ponmala, Vengara etc. manifesting the inhabitancy. Locality named
            like Valiyangadi, Kootilangadi, Pallipuram etc. points to the Jain -
            Buddhist history of Malappuram. Notably, the 1500 year old Jain
            Temple above 2000 ft sea level at Oorakam Hill of Malappuram
            undoubtedly proves the same.
