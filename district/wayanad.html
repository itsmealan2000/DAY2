            Wayanad district is in the north-east of Kerala state. It is set
            high on the Western Ghats with altitudes ranging from 700 to 2100
            meters. About 885.92 sq.km of area of the district is under forest.
            There are many indigenous tribals in this area. Agriculture is the
            backbone of the economy of the district. Most of the lands in the
            district are use for agricultural purposes. More than half of its
            population are engaged in agriculture in order to earn their
            livelihood. The chief agricultural crops in the district are Coffee,
            tea, cocoa, pepper, plantain, vanilla, rice, coconut, cardamom, tea,
            ginger, etc.

            The name Wayanad is derived from Vayal Nadu which means the land of
            paddy fields. Pulpally in Wayanad boasts of the only Lava- Kusha
            temple in Kerala and Vythiri has the only mirror temple in Kerala
            which is a Jain temple. The edicts and caves of Ambukuthi Mala and
            another evidence state that the place is as old as the beginning of
            the New Age Civilisation. Much evidence of New Stone Age
            civilisation can be seen in the hills throughout the present day
            Wayanad district. The Edakkal Caves has 6000-year-old rock
            engravings from the Neolithic age.

            Banasura Sagar Dam across the Karamanathodu River, a tributary of
            River Kabini, in Kalpetta, is considered to be the largest earth dam
            in India and the second largest in Asia. The dam is ideally placed
            in the foothills of Banasura hills, which got its name from
            'Banasura', the son of King Mahabali, the famous ruler of Kerala.
